# GitHub Activity CLI

A simple Python command-line tool to fetch and display recent public activity from a GitHub user using the GitHub REST API ‚Äî **without using any external libraries**.

---

## üåê Inspired by roadmap.sh
This project is based on the GitHub User Activity challenge from roadmap.sh, which guides you through building a CLI tool that consumes the GitHub API and shows recent activity in the terminal.

Check the original challenge here:
[roadmap.sh/projects/github-user-activity](https://roadmap.sh/projects/github-user-activity)

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

- Python 3.x
- No external libraries required (uses only the Python standard library)
